# Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service for Amazon Bedrock

This document outlines Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service for their AI services provided through Amazon Bedrock, with several key provisions regarding proprietary code usage.

## Customer Content and Code Ownership

Anthropic explicitly states that customers retain full ownership of their proprietary code and content. The technology provided by Anthropic to AWS does not give Anthropic access to the customer's AWS instance, including prompts or outputs ("Customer Content"). Anthropic disclaims any rights to customer content and assigns to customers all rights to outputs generated from their proprietary data.

## Restrictions on Training with Customer Code

A critical protection for proprietary code is that Anthropic may not train models on customer content from services. This means your proprietary code cannot be used to improve Anthropic's models. However, Anthropic does receive usage data from AWS to monitor compliance and service performance, but this specifically excludes customer content.

## Fine-Tuning Services

The terms include provisions for fine-tuning services where customers can customize models using their own proprietary data ("Fine-Tuning Materials"). These materials are treated as customer content with the same ownership protections. The fine-tuning process is explicitly permitted and does not violate the prohibition on training, provided it's solely for the customer's use of the fine-tuning services.

## Use Restrictions for Competitive Purposes

Customers cannot use the services to build competing AI products or train competing AI models except as expressly approved by Anthropic. They also cannot reverse engineer or duplicate the services, or support third parties in such activities.

## Confidentiality Protections

Customer content, including proprietary code, is treated as confidential information with strict protection requirements. Both parties must protect confidential information with reasonable care and limit access to authorized personnel with a need-to-know basis.

## Indemnification Coverage

Anthropic provides indemnification protection for customers against third-party claims alleging that authorized use of the services violates patent, trade secret, trademark, or copyright rights. However, this protection excludes claims arising from customer modifications to services or outputs, or customer-provided prompts and data.

The terms are designed to provide strong protections for proprietary code while enabling customers to leverage Anthropic's AI capabilities through Amazon Bedrock's secure infrastructure.
